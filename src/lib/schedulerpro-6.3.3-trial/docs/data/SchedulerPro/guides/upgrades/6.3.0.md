# Upgrade guide for Scheduler Pro v6.3.0

## Naming simplification for project data properties

The `ProjectModel` can consume inline data for the different sorts of entities it supports: events, resources, 
assignments, dependencies, time ranges, resource time ranges and calendars. 

In the past, the configs and properties related to this has been named according to `[entityName]Data`: `eventsData`, 
`resourcesData`, `assignmentsData`, `dependenciesData`, `timeRangesData`, `resourcetimeRangesData` and `calendarsData`. 

This has been simplified to only `[entityName]`: `events`, `resources`, `assignments`, `dependencies`, `timeRanges`, 
`resourceTimeRanges` and `calendars`.

The old properties are still available but are marked as deprecated and will be removed in a future release. We 
recommend you update the names used in your code to avoid breakage later.

**Old code**

```javascript
const scheduler = new SchedulerPro({
    project : {
        eventsData : [ ... ],
        resourcesData : [ ... ],
        assignmentsData : [ ... ]
    }
})
```

**New code**

```javascript
const scheduler = new SchedulerPro({
    project : {
        events : [ ... ],
        resources : [ ... ],
        assignments : [ ... ]
    }
})
```

This change also applies to APIs that get or set the data on the `ProjectModel`, such as `inlineData`, and `json`. For
example:

**Old code**

```javascript
const { inlineData } = scheduler.project;

// inlineData would previously have `eventsData`, `resourcesData` etc. properties
```

**New code**

```javascript
const { inlineData } = scheduler.project;

// inlineData now has `events`, `resources` etc. properties. 
// Note that the old properties are still included too
```

## Re-enabled early rendering for projects loaded using the CRUD manager

When using early rendering (the default, tasks are rendered before scheduling calculations take place), we did not
actually render early when loading data using the projects CRUD manager functionality. This was an oversight when we 
added support for project settings to the CRUD manager a while back.

This has now been fixed, and early rendering is once again enabled for projects loaded using the CRUD manager. As a 
result, any renderers you have configured (e.g. for tasks, baselines etc.) might now be called earlier than before, and
with unscheduled data. If you are supplying incomplete task data (e.g. without one of `startDate`, `endDate`, 
`duration`), you might need to adjust your renderers to handle this correctly.

** Old code**

```javascript
const scheduler = new SchedulerPro({
    project : {
        loadUrl : '/api/projects',
        autoLoad : true
    },
    
    eventRenderer({ eventRecord }) {
        // If endDate was not passed in the data, it might be 
        // null here on first call with early rendering
        if (eventRecord.endDate.getTime() < someTimeStamp) {
            return 'This event is before some time';
        } 
        return 'This event is after some time';
    }
});
```

**New code**

```javascript
const scheduler = new SchedulerPro({
    project : {
        loadUrl : '/api/projects',
        autoLoad : true
    },
    
    eventRenderer({ eventRecord }) {
        if (!eventRecord.endDate) {
            // Handle case where called before scheduling calculations
            return 'This event has no end date yet';
        }
        if (eventRecord.endDate.getTime() < someTimeStamp) {
            return 'This event is before some time';
        } 
        return 'This event is after some time';
    }
});
```
