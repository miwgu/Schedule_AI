# What's new in SchedulerPro v6.2.4

## New `recurrentDatesTimeZone` field on calendar intervals

[CalendarIntervalModel](#SchedulerPro/model/CalendarIntervalModel) has got a new field specifying a timezone in which
[recurrentStartDate](#SchedulerPro/model/CalendarIntervalModel#field-recurrentStartDate) and
[recurrentEndDate](#SchedulerPro/model/CalendarIntervalModel#field-recurrentEndDate) rules are provided.

Until this release time info of the rules were always treated as specified in the local machine time zone.
But that could result inconsistencies when backend provided dates in some other timezone.
The new field should help in such cases.

Here is for example a dataset using the new field:

```js
{
    "calendars" : [
        {
            "id"        : "general",
            "name"      : "General",
            "intervals" : [
                {
                    // weekends are days off starting Sat 00:00 GMT+6 and finishing Mon 00:00 GMT+6
                    "recurrentStartDate"     : "on Sat",
                    "recurrentEndDate"       : "on Mon",
                    // specify we use GMT+6 for recurrent*Date rules
                    "recurrentDatesTimeZone" : "+06:00",
                    "isWorking"              : false
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "resources" : [
        { "id" : "r1", "name" : "Worker #1" }
    ],
    "assignments" : [
        { "id" : "a1", "resource" : "r1", "event" : 11 }
    ],
    "events" : [
        {
            "id"           : 11,
            "name"         : "Build a skyscraper",
            // event start is specified in GMT+6 timezone
            "startDate"    : "2017-01-16T00:00+06:00",
            "duration"     : 3,
            "durationUnit" : "hour"
        }
    ]
}
```

Loading of the above dataset on a machine with GMT timezone will adjust the non-working interval six hours back to
`Fri 18:00 - Sun 18:00` and the event will start `2017-01-15T18:00` accordingly.
