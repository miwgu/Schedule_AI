# What's new in Scheduler Pro v6.1.4

## Introducing thin trial NPM packages

Starting with the `6.1.4` release, there are now trial versions of thin NPM packages available on our NPM server.
These can be used to evaluate combining multiple products before purchasing a license.

Please check the combining multiple products guides for the trial packages list and installation tips:

* [Angular guide](#SchedulerPro/guides/integration/angular/multiple-products.md#thin-limited-trial-library-packages)
* [React guide](#SchedulerPro/guides/integration/react/multiple-products.md#thin-limited-trial-library-packages)
* [Vue guide](#SchedulerPro/guides/integration/vue/multiple-products.md#thin-limited-trial-library-packages)

## New `is{{ClassName}}` boolean property

Classes extending `Base` have got new `is{{ClassName}}` boolean property indicating instances of
the corresponding class or subclasses of thereof. The properties can be used for checking types without
need fo importing the corresponding types just to do `instanceof` check.

For example `EventModel` class is automatically decorated with `isEventModel` property returning `true`.
And `EventSegmentModel` has `isEventSegmentModel` as `true` respectively. Then the following code can
be used for checking the corresponding types:

```javascript
    eventRenderer({ eventRecord }) {
        // if that's a segment
        if (eventRecord.isEventSegmentModel) {
            // ...render a segment
        }
        // that's an event
        else {
            ...
        }
    },
```

## `ProjectModel` and `EventSegmentModel` classes has got new properties

`ProjectModel` class has got new `segmentModelClass` property allowing to override the class used for
representing a segment:

```javascript
// a custom class for a segment
class MySegment extends EventSegmentModel {
    static fields = [
       // a custom segment field
       { name : 'responsiblePerson' }
    ];
}

new SchedulerPro({
    project : {
        // tell the project to use the new class for segments
        segmentModelClass : MySegment
    }
})
```

`EventSegmentModel` class has got new `segmentIndex` property providing zero-based index of the segment.
