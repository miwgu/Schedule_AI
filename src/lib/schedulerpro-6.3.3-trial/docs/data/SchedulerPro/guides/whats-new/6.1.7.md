# What's new in SchedulerPro v6.1.7

## New `scrollAction` config in CellEditing

The `scrollAction` config specifies what action should be taken if an active cell editor is scrolled out of view.

It may be set to `'cancel'`, `'complete'` or `null`.

The default value is `null` which means the edit is preserved.

## New `roundedSplit` config introduced in `EventSegments` feature

The `roundedSplit` config allows user, when is set to `false`, to split events using the exact clicked date. When the config value is `true` (default) the feature uses a rounded date.

```javascript
new SchedulerPro({
    ...
    features : {
        eventSegments : {
            // split at the exact date user clicks in UI
            roundedSplit : false
        }
    }
})
```
