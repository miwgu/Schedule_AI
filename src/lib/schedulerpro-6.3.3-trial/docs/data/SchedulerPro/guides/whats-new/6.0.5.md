# What's new in Scheduler Pro v6.0.5

## Dependency creation just for parent events

The `Dependency` feature has a new config that only applies when using nested events: `allowCreateOnlyParent`. Set it to `true` to allow
dependency creation only for parent events. Normally the nested event container inside parent events cannot be scrolled when using dependencies, but by enabling this setting and limiting to where dependencies can be drawn scrolling will be enabled.

```javascript
new Scheduler({
    ...
    features : {
        nestedEvents : true,
        dependencies : {
            allowCreateOnlyParent : true
        }
    },
    ...
});
```
