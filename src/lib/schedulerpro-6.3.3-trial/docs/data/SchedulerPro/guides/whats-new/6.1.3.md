## New `keepTime` modes for `StartDateField` and `EndDateField` classes

The `StartDateField` and `EndDateField` classes processing of time values differs from the standard
`DateField` behavior. So it was decided to make separate modes for them:

- `StartDateField` `keepTime` config has got a new `sod` mode (default for the field).
  When the mode is enabled the field adjusts its value time portion to start of the working day.
  The adjustment is skipped when loading a record value to the field.

- `EndDateField` `keepTime` config has got a new `eod` mode (default for the field).
  When the mode is enabled the field adjusts its value time portion to end of the working day.
  The adjustment is skipped when loading a record value to the field.
