# What's new in SchedulerPro v6.2.0

## New `respectStoreFilters` and `assignmentFilterFn` config on the `ResourceHistogram` view

`ResourceHistogram` class has got new configs giving more control on data filtering
when collecting resource allocation:

* [respectStoreFilters](#SchedulerPro/view/ResourceHistogram#config-respectStoreFilters) boolean config that allows to
specify whether exiting event and assignment store filters should be taken into account or not:

```javascript
new ResourceHistogram({
    // skip filtered out events/assignments
    respectStoreFilters : true,
    ...
});

// Filter event store to include only event w/ id === 777
// That will result the histogram displays only that event allocation
project.eventStore.filter(event => event.id === 777);
```

The config is `false` by default so the filters are not taken into account.
* [assignmentFilterFn](#SchedulerPro/view/ResourceHistogram#config-assignmentFilterFn) config accepts a function that specifies whether the provided assignment allocation
should be included or not:

```javascript
new ResourceHistogram({
    // custom filtering function
    * assignmentFilterFn(assignment) {
        // get the assignment event
        const event = yield assignment.$.event;

        // include only allocation of events having 'Meeting' type
        return event && event.kind === 'Meeting';
    },
    ...
});
```
