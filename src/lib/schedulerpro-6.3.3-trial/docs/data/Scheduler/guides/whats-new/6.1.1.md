# What's new in Scheduler v6.1.1

## Partnered Scheduler's locked region width syncing

If you partner two Schedulers which both uses a calculated width for their locked `regions`, the synced `region` width
will from this version be the largest of the two. The previous behavior was to always use the `partner's` width.

Since the region only use a calculated width when all column widths are know, you can simply configure the locked
`region` width manually.

```javascript
const firstScheduler = new Scheduler({
    subGridConfigs : {
        locked : 100 // fixed with 
    }
});

const secondScheduler = new Scheduler({
    partner : firstScheduler
});
```
