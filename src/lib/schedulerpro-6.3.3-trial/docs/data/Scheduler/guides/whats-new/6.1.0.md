# What's new in Scheduler v6.1.0

## New DependencyMenu feature

You can now show a menu when right-clicking a dependency line.

```javascript
new Scheduler({
    ...
    features : {
        dependencyMenu : true
    },
    ...
});
```

<div class="external-example" data-file="Scheduler/feature/Dependencies.js"></div>

## Remote paging, sorting and filtering added to Store

The ability to sort, filter and paginate records remotely was previously only available when using an `AjaxStore`
configured with a `readUrl`. Now, it is possible to use the built-in functionality and UI controls when using a regular
Store.

3 new configs has been added to Store:
* [remotePaging](#Core/data/Store#config-remotePaging)
* [remoteSort](#Core/data/Store#config-remoteSort)
* [remoteFilter](#Core/data/Store#config-remoteFilter)

Turning any of these functions on is a simple matter of setting the config to `true`, and then implementing a way of
providing the correct data to the Store. For that, the [requestData](#Core/data/Store#config-requestData) function
needs to be implemented. Here is a simple example using paging, sorting and filtering:

```javascript
const store = new Store({
    remotePaging : true,
    remoteFilter : true,
    remoteSort   : true,
    requestData({ filters, sorters, page, pageSize }){
        let filteredRecords = [...allRecords];

        filters?.forEach(filter => {
            const { field, operator, value, caseSensitive } = filter;

            if(operator === '='){
                filteredRecords = filteredRecords.filter(r => r[field] === value);
            }
            else {
                /// ... implement other filter operators
            }
        });

        sorters?.forEach(sorter => filteredRecords.sort((a,b) => {
            const { field, ascending } = sorter;

            if (!ascending) {
                ([b, a] = [a, b]);
            }

            return a[field] > b[field] ? 1 : (a[field] < b[field] ? -1 : 0)
        }));

        const start = (page - 1) * pageSize;
        const data = filteredRecords.splice(start, start + pageSize);

        return {
            data,
            total : filteredRecords.length
        }

    }
});
```

For a more detailed explanation please see the updated [Store guide](#Scheduler/guides/data/displayingdata.md). There is
also a new [Grid demo](https://bryntum.com/products/grid/examples/remote-nonajax/) that demonstrates the new
functionality.

## Paging support

Support for paging of data has been added to the Scheduler. The config belongs to the Store or the CrudManager and
supports both AjaxStore and regular Store data requests (see previous chapter).

Example of Scheduler with paged AjaxStores:

```javascript
const scheduler = new Scheduler({
    resourceStore : {
        remotePaging : true,
        readUrl : './resources' 
    }, 
    eventStore : {
        remotePaging : true,
        readUrl : '/events'
    },
    bbar : {
        type : 'pagingtoolbar',
        store : 'resourceStore'
    }
});
```

Examples of Scheduler with paged CrudManager:

```javascript
const scheduler = new Scheduler({
    crudManager : {
        remotePaging : true,
        read : './read'
    },
    bbar : {
        type : 'pagingtoolbar',
        store : 'resourceStore'
    }
});
```

For a more detailed explanation please see the new [Paging guide](#Scheduler/guides/data/paging.md). There is also a new
[demo](https://bryntum.com/products/scheduler/examples/paged/) that demonstrates the new functionality.

## Vertical lazy loading when Resource Store is not lazy
A lazy loaded EventStore, AssignmentStore and ResourceTimeRangeStore will now lazy load when scrolling vertically, even
when the ResourceStore is not lazy loaded. The previous behavior, which can be configured by setting 
`loadFullResourceRange` to `true` on the Store's `lazyLoad` config, was to always load the full resource range.

Revert to old behavior:

```javascript
const scheduler = new Scheduler({
    resourceStore : {
        // Not really needed, here to be clear this only applies to a ResourceStore that is not lazy loaded
        data,
        lazyLoad : false 
    },
    eventStore : {
        lazyLoad : {
            loadFullResourceRange : true
        }
    }
});
```

## Timeline boundaries

You can now set boundaries for the timeline using two new properties:  `minDate` and  `maxDate`.
Actions such as timeline scrolling, all types of timeline zooms, and shifts will respect these limits.

```javascript
const scheduler = new Scheduler({
    appendTo : 'container',
    minDate  : new Date(2016, 5, 1),
    maxDate  : new Date(2018, 5, 1),
});
```
