# What's new in Scheduler v6.0.5

## New event for tick size and new behaviour

With this release, when tick size changes, center position will be maintained.
Moreover we have added a `tickSizeChange` event that is fired when the tick size changes.

```javascript
listeners : {
    tickSizeChange({ source, tickSize }) {
        ....
    },
}
```

## Snap to resource

The `EventDrag` feature has new property: `snapToResource`. Set it to `true` to be able to snap events
to resources while dragging events, i.e. vertical row snap in horizontal mode and vice versa.
If you want to customize the number of pixels from the dragged event that will trigger the snapping behavior
to the new resource, you can set the `threshold` property.
It works only if [snap](#Scheduler/view/mixin/TimelineDateMapper#config-snap) value is `true`.

```javascript
new Scheduler({
    ...
    snap     : true,
    features : {
        eventDrag : {
            snapToResource : {
                threshold : 30
            }
        }
    },
    ...
});
```
