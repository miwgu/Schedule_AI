# Upgrade guide for Scheduler v6.3.0

## Naming simplification for project data properties

The `ProjectModel` can consume inline data for the different sorts of entities it supports: events, resources, 
assignments, dependencies, time ranges and resource time ranges. 

In the past, the configs and properties related to this has been named according to `[entityName]Data`: `eventsData`, 
`resourcesData`, `assignmentsData`, `dependenciesData`, `timeRangesData` and `resourcetimeRangesData`. 

This has been simplified to only `[entityName]`: `events`, `resources`, `assignments`, `dependencies`, `timeRanges` and 
`resourceTimeRanges`.

The old properties are still available but are marked as deprecated and will be removed in a future release. We 
recommend you update the names used in your code to avoid breakage later.

**Old code**

```javascript
const scheduler = new Scheduler({
    project : {
        eventsData : [ ... ],
        resourcesData : [ ... ],
        assignmentsData : [ ... ]
    }
})
```

**New code**

```javascript
const scheduler = new Scheduler({
    project : {
        events : [ ... ],
        resources : [ ... ],
        assignments : [ ... ]
    }
})
```

This change also applies to APIs that get or set the data on the `ProjectModel`, such as `inlineData`, and `json`. For
example:

**Old code**

```javascript
const { inlineData } = scheduler.project;

// inlineData would previously have `eventsData`, `resourcesData` etc. properties
```

**New code**

```javascript
const { inlineData } = scheduler.project;

// inlineData now has `events`, `resources` etc. properties. 
// Note that the old properties are still included too
```
