# Upgrade guide for Scheduler v6.1.8

## CrudManager event param `responseOptions` was renamed
The `responseOptions` event param in `CrudManager` load/sync events (`load`, `loadFail`, `sync`, `syncFail`, 
`requestDone`, `requestFail`) was renamed to `requestOptions`. Please review your CrudManager event handlers and update 
the param name accordingly.

Old code:

```javascript
new Scheduler({
    crudManager : {
        loadUrl   : 'url.php',
        listeners : {
            requestDone({ responseOptions }) {
                
            },
            loadFail({ responseOptions }) {
                
            }
        }
    }
})
```

New code:

```javascript
new Scheduler({
    crudManager : {
        loadUrl   : 'url.php',
        listeners : {
            requestFail({ rawResponse, requestOptions }) {
                
            },
            loadFail({ rawResponse, requestOptions }) {
                
            }
        }
    }
})
```

## `createEventOnDblClick` deprecated
A new config, `autoCreate` takes the place of the `createEventOnDblClick` config (though that will still work until
version 7.0).

`autoCreate` allows you to configure the DOM event name which creates an event. This defaults to `dblclick` as before.
It also allows other parameters of the new event to be specified.

No code changes are necessary unless you have set this to `false`. In which case, make the following change before 7.0 arrives:

Old code:

```javascript
    createEventOnDblClick : false
```

New code:

```javascript
    autoCreate : false
```
