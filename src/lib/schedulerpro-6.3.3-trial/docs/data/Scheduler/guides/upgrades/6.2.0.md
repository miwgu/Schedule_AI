# Upgrade guide for Scheduler v6.2.0

## EventColorPicker record config is deprecated

The `record` config of `EventColorPicker` has been deprecated in favor of the new `records` config, which
allows changing the `color` property for multiple selected records. The old `record` config is still there, but it
will be removed in the v7.0.0 release. Please update your code accordingly.

Old code:

```javascript
new EventColorPicker({
    record : firstEvent
})
```

New code:

```javascript
new EventColorPicker({
    records : [firstEvent]
})
```

## AjaxHelper.fetch credentials change

The `AjaxHelper.fetch()` utility function is used by `AjaxStore` and `CrudManager` to fetch data from the server.
Previously it by default used the `credentials: 'include'` option, which meant that cookies were always sent with the
request. To better match the default behavior of the native `fetch` API, our default value has been removed (thus it
instead uses `'same-origin'`, which is the native default). If you want to restore the old behavior, you can do so using 
`AjaxHelper.DEFAULT_FETCH_OPTIONS`:

**Old code**

```javascript
new CrudManager({
    loadUrl  : 'load.php',
    autoLoad : true
})
```

**New code**

```javascript
AjaxHelper.DEFAULT_FETCH_OPTIONS = { credentials : 'include' };

new CrudManager({
    loadUrl  : 'load.php',
    autoLoad : true
})
```
