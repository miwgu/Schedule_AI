# What's new in Grid 6.3.0

## New Chart module

Bryntum products now ship with a new `Chart` module, which makes it easier to integrate `Chart.js`-based charts 
(see [www.chartjs.org](https://www.chartjs.org)) with our products. The new module can be combined with all our
products, by using the `thin` bundles / packages.

Building upon the new module, Grid now has a `Charts` feature, which leverages the new `Chart` and `ChartDesigner`
widgets to enable developers and end users to easily create charts and visualize data directly from selected cells in a
Grid.

Grid also has new columns that can show charts: `SparklineColumn` and `ChartColumn`.

Try the new feature out in the new `charts` demo, and see how to use the new `SparklineColumn` in the `sparklines` demo.

Using charts with your applications:

If you are using a vanilla JavaScript application, you need to import the chart thin bundle to enable support for the
`Charts` feature:

```javascript
import 'PATH_TO_DISTRIBUTION_FOLDER/build/thin/chart.module.thin.js';
```

For framework-based applications, the Bryntum npm repository provides the `@bryntum/chart-thin` package, along with
chart component wrapper packages for major frameworks:

**Angular:**

```typescript
import '@bryntum/chart-thin'
import { BryntumChart } from '@bryntum/chart-angular-thin'
```

**React:**

```typescript
import '@bryntum/chart-thin'
import { BryntumChart } from '@bryntum/chart-react-thin'
```

**Vue 3:**

```typescript
import '@bryntum/chart-thin'
import { BryntumChart } from '@bryntum/chart-vue-3-thin'
```

## Streamed PDF export

The `PdfExport` feature now supports exporting large datasets by streaming data to the export server using a WebSocket
connection. This allows for more efficient handling of large datasets during export operations, improving performance
and reducing memory usage
