# What's new in Grid v6.1.6

## WebComponent support in CellEditing

In this release we have added support to change the input field tag name of a column's cell editor. This is especially
useful when you want an Angular component as an editor. Please be advised that this component must fulfill the API of a
regular input field, for example getters and setters for `value`, and also `select` and `focus` functions. Also, this 
tag must be a component defined as a 
[Custom element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements). 

```javascript
const grid = new Grid({
    columns : [
        {
            field  : 'name',
            editor : {
                // Tag name for a registered WebComponent
                inputTag : 'custom-input'
            }
        },
        { field : 'city' }
    ]
});
```

Please take a look at this new [Angular demo](https://bryntum.com/products/grid/examples/frameworks/angular/celledit),
which exemplifies the implementation in detail.
