# What's new in Grid v6.1.0

## Remote paging, sorting and filtering added to Store

The ability to sort, filter and paginate records remotely was previously only available when using an `AjaxStore` 
configured with a `readUrl`. Now, it is possible to use the built-in functionality and UI controls when using a regular
Store.

3 new configs has been added to Store:
* [remotePaging](#Core/data/Store#config-remotePaging)
* [remoteSort](#Core/data/Store#config-remoteSort)
* [remoteFilter](#Core/data/Store#config-remoteFilter)

Turning any of these functions on is a simple matter of setting the config to `true`, and then implementing a way of 
providing the correct data to the Store. For that, the [requestData](#Core/data/Store#config-requestData) function 
needs to be implemented. Here is a simple example using paging, sorting and filtering:

```javascript
const store = new Store({
   remotePaging : true, 
   remoteFilter : true,
   remoteSort   : true,
   requestData({ filters, sorters, page, pageSize }){
      let filteredRecords = [...allRecords];

      filters?.forEach(filter => {
         const { field, operator, value, caseSensitive } = filter;

         if(operator === '='){
             filteredRecords = filteredRecords.filter(r => r[field] === value);
         }
         else {
             /// ... implement other filter operators
         }
      });

      sorters?.forEach(sorter => filteredRecords.sort((a,b) => {
         const { field, ascending } = sorter;

         if (!ascending) {
             ([b, a] = [a, b]);
         }

         return a[field] > b[field] ? 1 : (a[field] < b[field] ? -1 : 0)
      }));

      const start = (page - 1) * pageSize;
      const data = filteredRecords.splice(start, start + pageSize);

      return {
         data,
         total : filteredRecords.length
      }

   }
});
```

For a more detailed explanation please see the updated [Store guide](#Grid/guides/data/displayingdata.md). There is also 
a new [demo](https://bryntum.com/products/grid/examples/remote-nonajax) that demonstrates the new functionality.

## Calculated record fields

The `Model` class now supports fields that are calculated based on other fields in the model. This is done by adding a
`calculate` property to the field definition. Here is an example:

```javascript
class MyModel extends Model {
    static fields = [
        { name : 'name', type : 'string' },
        { name : 'age', type : 'number' },
        { name : 'isAdult', calculate : data => data.age >= 18 }
    ];
}
```

Fields used in the `calculate` function will when possible be automatically added as dependencies, so that the 
calculated field is updated whenever the dependent fields change. For complex calculations, it is also possible to 
specify the fields that the calculation depends on:

```javascript
class MyModel extends Model {
    static fields = [
        { name : 'name', type : 'string' },
        { name : 'age', type : 'number' },
        { name : 'isAdult', calculate : { dependsOn : ['age'], fn : data => data.age >= 18 } }
    ];
}
```

## Data transformation configs

`AjaxStore` now has a set of callbacks that lets you transform data being passed to or received from the backend:
* `transformLoadedData`: Transforms data from the backend before loading it into the store.
* `transformCreationData`: Transforms creation requests before sending to the backend.
* `transformModificationData`: Transforms modification data before sending to the backend.
* `transformRemovalData`: Transforms removal data before sending to the backend.

Please see the API docs for each config for more information.

## Summaries for TreeGroup feature

You can now show summaries in each TreeGroup parent row by configuring columns with a
[sum](#Grid/column/Column#config-sum).

```javascript
new Grid({
    features : { treeGroup : true },
    columns : [
        {
            text  : 'Name',
            field : 'name',
            flex  : 3,
            type  : 'tree'
        },
        {
            type  : 'number',
            text  : 'Capacity',
            field : 'capacity',
            flex  : 1,
            sum   : 'add'
        },
        {
            type  : 'number',
            text  : 'Crew',
            field : 'crew',
            flex  : 1,
            sum   : 'add'
        }
    ]
});
```

## Excel export improvements

We replaced zipcelx library with more flexible write-excel-file which supports cell styling and formatting. We improved
API to allow using any other library. We still ship older version of zipcelx as a fallback. Grid demo has been updated
to show how to style cells.
