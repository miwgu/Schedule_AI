# What's new in Grid v6.1.7

## New `scrollAction` config in CellEditing

The `scrollAction` config specifies what action should be taken if an active cell editor is scrolled out of view.

It may be set to `'cancel'`, `'complete'` or `null`.

The default value is `null` which means the edit is preserved.

## Floating cell editor

The `CellEdit` feature now supports rendering the editor as a floating element outside the cell element. Set the 
`cellEditor` config to an object with a `floating` property set to `true`.

```javascript
new Grid({
   columns : [
       {
           field : 'name',
           text : 'Name',
           editor : {
               type : 'my-custom-field'
           },
           cellEditor : {
               floating : true
           }
       }
   ] 
});
```
