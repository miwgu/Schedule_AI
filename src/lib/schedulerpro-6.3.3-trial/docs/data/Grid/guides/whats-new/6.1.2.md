## New way of chaining tree stores

`Store` has a new better way of chaining tree stores. By using `chainTree()` instead of `chain()`, the chained store 
will be a full tree store with links to the nodes in the original store. This will let you expand / collapse and filter 
the tree in one store without affecting the other.

```javascript
const originalStore = new Store({
    tree : true,
    data : [
        { 
            id : 1, 
            name : 'Parent', 
            children : [
                { id : 11, name : 'Child' }
            ]
        }
    ]
});

const chainedStore = originalStore.chainTree();
```

`chainedStore` in the snippet above will have the same structure as `originalStore`. But the nodes in it will be links
to the nodes in `originalStore`. CRUD operation to the chained store will affect the original store, but UI operations
such as expand / collapse and filtering will only affect the chained store (and vice versa).
