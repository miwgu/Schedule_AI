# Upgrade guide for Grid v6.0.0

## The default behaviour of the column renderer has changed

Previously, if a column defined renderer return `undefined` (or has no return statement) this will prevent the cell
element content from being updated. This is useful if the cell element is mutated inside the renderer, which would
otherwise be overwritten by the internal rendering later on.

Example of previous default behaviour:

```javascript
new Grid({
    columns : [{
        renderer({ record, cellElement }) {
            cellElement.appendChild(someElement);
            return undefined; // The return statement can also be omitted
        }
    }]
});
```

In 6.0, the cell content is by default always updated after the renderer call. This means that there is no need for
`undefined` checks like it was before.

```javascript
const oldColumnConfig = { renderer : ({ record }) => record.myProperty ?? '' }
const newColumnConfig = { renderer : ({ record }) => record.myProperty }
```

For those cases when the cellElement content is directly manipulated inside the renderer simply set the 
`alwaysClearCell` to `false` on the column. This config has been available since 5.2.5 but as of 6.0 it defaults to 
`true`. Set `alwaysClearCell` to `false` on every column that relies on the previous default behaviour when updating to
6.0.

Example of new default behaviour:

```javascript
new Grid({
    columns : [{
        alwaysClearCell : false,
        renderer({ record, cellElement }) {
            cellElement.appendChild(someElement);
            return undefined; // The return statement can also be ommitted
        }
    }]
});
```

## Field´s `highlightExternalChange` default value

Field´s `highlightExternalChange` default value is now `false` (previously `true`). If you want fields to highlight,
you will need to explicitly set this config on your fields.

## DateColumn now warns when not defining a proper DateDataField in the Model

When using a DateColumn your data model should define a matching `field` with the `type` set to `date`. As of 6.0,
you will see a warning in the console, and you should take action to update your Model class field definition. The 
DateColumn will also update the existing field to be a DateDataField on the fly. See below for how to define your own
custom model field.

```javascript
class Person extends Model {
    static fields = [
        'name',
        { name : 'dateOfBirth', type : 'date' }
    ];
}

new Grid({
    store : {
        modelClass : Person
    },
    columns : [{
        type  : 'date',
        field : 'dateOfBirth'
    }]
});
```

## `keepDate` config of the TimeField class now defaults to `true`

If you relied on this flag being `false`, you will now need to set it explicitly in your TimeFields

```javascript
new TimeField({
    keepDate : false
});
```

## `DomHelper.focusWithoutScrolling` removed
`DomHelper.focusWithoutScrolling` was deprecated in v5.6.4 because the native Element focus method now supports
the `preventScroll` option on all platforms.

```javascript
DomHelper.focusWithoutScrolling(myElement);
```

Should be changed to

```javascript
myElement.focus({ preventScroll : true });
```

## New location for `Core.util.helper.Point` class

The `Core.util.helper.Point` class was moved in v5.6.0 to solve circular module dependencies. It is now a named 
(`Point`) export of the `Core.util.helper.Rectangle` module.

Changes are required if you are directly importing the class from sources:

**Old code:**

```javascript
import Point from 'path-to-lib/Core/helper/util/Point.js';
```

**New code:**

```javascript
import { Point } from 'path-to-lib/Core/helper/util/Rectangle.js';
```

Note: No changes required for importing from module or umd bundles.

## Export dialog `values` API has changed

Earlier implementation of `values` API applied transformation to the field names: `orientationField` -> `orientation`.
We rolled it back to default implementation used by `Container` and solved this task by providing a `name` field on 
every default widget. If you have added more widgets to the default dialog, check the `values` object of the dialog, you 
might need to configure `name`.

## Filter feature changed to multi-filter by default

The Filter feature has changed to use the new [FieldFilterPicker](#Core/widget/FieldFilterPicker)-based
UI in its popup by default. (This mode was previously accessible using the `isMulti` flag, which is now
removed.)

The feature's context menus have also changed. Now, when right-clicking a grid cell or column header, the
filtering options are under a new Filter sub-menu. The available filter operators have also changed to
match the ones available in the `FieldFilterPicker` for the column's data type.

To provide custom configuration for the [GridFieldFilterPickerGroup](#Grid/widget/GridFieldFilterPickerGroup)
used in the popup UI, pass the new `pickerConfig` config to the Filter feature.

To use the old UI instead, configure `legacyMode : true` on the Filter feature.

- Old feature configuration:

```javascript
{
  features : {
    filter : true
  }
}
```

- New feature configuration (to opt out of new UI and keep the old):

```javascript
{
  features : {
    filter : {
      legacyMode : true
    }
  }
}
```

## The `autoClose` config of `PickerField` was removed

The `autoClose` config of `PickerField` controlled if the picker was hidden when the user clicks outside the picker. 
Setting it to false lead to a non-intuitive behavior, which we no longer support. The config was deprecated in v5.5.5 
and has now been removed.

## RowCopyPaste has been made asynchronous

The RowCopyPaste feature's `copyRows` and `pasteRows` was made asynchronous in V5.5.5. This makes the `beforeCopy` and
`beforePaste` events asynchronously preventable and allows for native Clipboard API support.

If your code relies on a copy or paste action to complete, you will need to wait for the promise to be resolved.

**Old code:**

```javascript
function copyPaste()
{
    grid.copyRows();
    doSomethingElse();
    grid.pasteRows();
    finishDoingSomethingElse();
}
```

**New code:**

```javascript
async function copyPaste()
{
    await grid.copyRows();
    doSomethingElse();
    await grid.pasteRows();
    finishDoingSomethingElse();
}
```

...or...

```javascript
function copyPaste()
{
    return grid.copyRows().then(() => {
        doSomethingElse();
        grid.pasteRows().then(() => {
            finishDoingSomethingElse();
            return true;
        });
    });
}
```

## `RowExpander` feature auto scrolling now defaults to `false`

Previously, when expanding a row and the expanded body element was not completely in view, the `RowExpander` feature
would scroll that element into view automatically. Since v5.3.8, this behaviour will need to be activated by setting the
`autoScroll` config on the `RowExpander` feature to `true`. 

## `Sort` feature now creates sorting icon element in header cell.

The CSS to create and show the arrow icon to indicate sort direction is since v5.3.7 a `:before` pseudo element of a 
child element of the header text element. There is now an addressable `.b-sort-icon` node inside the cell which may be 
targeted by application CSS.

In previous versions, the arrow icon was a `:before` pseudo element of the header text element and not addressable by 
application code or CSS.

## `RowReorder` events fired on the Grid instance

Prior to v5.3.3 they were fired on the `RowReorder` feature instance. Now they are fired on the `Grid` instance.

**Old code:**

```javascript
const grid = new Grid({
    appendTo : 'container',
    features : {
        rowReorder : {
            showGrip  : true,
            listeners : {
                gridRowBeforeDropFinalize : async({ context }) => {
                    if (grid.widgetMap.confirmationButton.checked) {
                        const result = await MessageDialog.confirm({
                            title   : 'Please confirm',
                            message : 'Did you want the row here?'
                        });

                        // Return true to accept the drop or false to reject it
                        return result === MessageDialog.yesButton;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
})
```

**New code:**

```javascript
const grid = new Grid({
    appendTo : 'container',
    features : {
        rowReorder : {
            showGrip  : true
        }
    },
    listeners : {
        gridRowBeforeDropFinalize : async({ context }) => {
            if (grid.widgetMap.confirmationButton.checked) {
                const result = await MessageDialog.confirm({
                    title   : 'Please confirm',
                    message : 'Did you want the row here?'
                });

                // Return true to accept the drop or false to reject it
                return result === MessageDialog.yesButton;
            }
        }
    }
})
```

## Angular View Engine wrappers for Angular 11 and older versions

In v5.3.3 a new `@bryntum/grid-angular-view` package designed to work with Angular 11 and older versions was added, 
which use the View Engine for rendering. If you are using one of the legacy Angular versions, please follow these 
steps to use the package:

Install the package using npm:

```shell
npm install @bryntum/grid-angular-view@6.0.0
```

Import the component in your Angular application:

```typescript
import { BryntumGridComponent } from '@bryntum/grid-angular-view';
```

Do not forget to remove previously used `@bryntum/grid-angular` package which requires Angular 12 or newer version.

Please check [Angular integration guide](#Grid/guides/integration/angular/guide.md#ivy-and-view-engine-wrappers) for
additional information.

## Button, Checkbox, Radio, SlideToggle & Toast CSS changes

The CSS for these widgets was changed in v5.3.0 - instead of letting SASS generate CSS for the built-in color variations 
it now uses internal CSS variables.

The upside of this change is that it removes thousands of lines of CSS, while also making it easier for us to add more
colors in the future.

We don't expect it to affect the styling of existing applications much, but if your application use custom styling for
these widgets you might need to adjust the specificity of some selectors.

With the change, the following SCSS variables are no longer used and was removed:

`$button-hover-lightness`
`$button-pressed-lightness`
`$button-active-lightness`
`$button-pressed-hover-lightness`
`$button-active-hover-lightness`
`$button-pressed-active-lightness`
`$button-pressed-active-hover-lightness`
`$checkbox-checked-box-color`
`$checkbox-checked-box-background-color`
`$checkbox-checked-box-border-color`
`$radio-background-color`
`$radio-border-color`
`$radio-dot-color`
`$radio-checked-dot-color`
`$radio-checked-border-color`
`$radio-checked-background-color`
`$radio-disabled-background-color`             
`$radio-disabled-border-color`

There is not a 1-1 mapping to anything in the updated CSS, therefor if you are using any of these SCSS variables we
recommend checking the corresponding CSS files to figure out what to use instead (see `button.scss`, `checkbox.scss`,
`radio.scss`). Or post a question on the [forum](https://forum.bryntum.com).

## Localization update

`LocaleManager.registerLocale` was deprecated in 5.3.0 and has now been removed.
[LocaleHelper.publishLocale](#Core/localization/LocaleHelper#function-publishLocale-static) should be used instead.

**Old code:**

```javascript
LocaleManager.registerLocale('Es', {
    desc : 'Spanish', locale : {
        localeName : 'Es',
        localeDesc : 'Spanish',
        locale     : {
            /* localization */
        }
    }
});
```

**New code:**

```javascript
LocaleHelper.publishLocale({
    localeName : 'Es',
    localeDesc : 'Spanish',
    localeCode : 'es',
    /* localization */
});
```

`LocaleManager.extendLocale` was deprecated in 5.3.0 and has now been removed.
[LocaleManager.applyLocale](#Core/localization/LocaleManager#function-applyLocale) should be used instead.

**Old code:**

```javascript
LocaleManager.extendLocale('Es', {
    desc : 'Spanish', locale : {
        locale : {
            /* localization */
        }
    }
});
```

**New code:**

```javascript
LocaleManager.applyLocale({
    localeName : 'Es',
    localeDesc : 'Spanish',
    localeCode : 'es',
    /* localization */
});
```

Check our [localization guide](#Grid/guides/customization/localization.md#locales) for the details.

## Grid `selectionMode` changes

With the introduction of cell selection, Grid's `selectionMode` config since v5.3.0 no longer has the `row` setting. 
Instead, it is the default mode and can be omitted. Specifying `cell : true` will enable cell selection and disable row 
selection - both cannot be used at the same time.

While you don't actually have to change your code, the `row` setting no longer has any effect and can be removed:

**Old code:**

```javascript
new Grid({
    selectionMode : {
        row : false,
        cell : true
    }
});
```

**New code:**

```javascript
new Grid({
    selectionMode : {
        cell : true
    }
});
```

The `rowCheckboxSelection` setting of Grid's `selectionMode` config was in the same version renamed to `checkboxOnly`, 
to better indicate its purpose. Please update your code accordingly:

**Old code:**

```javascript
new Grid({
    selectionMode : {
        rowCheckboxSelection : true
    }
});
```

**New code:**

```javascript
new Grid({
    selectionMode : {
        checkboxOnly : true
    }
});
```

## Deprecated menuContext.event

The `event` property available on the `menuContext` property of context menu features has been deprecated in favor of
the `domEvent` property, to reduce risk of confusion with a Bryntum event object or an event record in Scheduler. If you
are using it, please change your code to use `domEvent` instead.

**Old code:**

```javascript
console.log(grid.features.cellMenu.menuContext.event);
```

**New code:**

```javascript
console.log(grid.features.cellMenu.menuContext.domEvent);
```

## GridFieldFilterPicker `fields` configuration type change

The type of the `fields` config for `GridFieldFilterPicker` and `GridFieldFilterPickerGroup` widgets was in v5.3.0 
changed from array of `FieldOption`s to `Object` map of `FieldOption`s keyed by field name. The array type is now 
removed. The fields supplied in this config (if any) will now be merged with fields found in the configured `grid`'s 
columns, instead of overwriting them.

**Old code:**

```javascript
new GridFieldFilterPickerGroup({
    fields : [{
        name  : 'myStringField',
        type  : 'string'
    }, {
        name  : 'myNumberField',
        type  : 'number',
        title : 'MyNumber'
    }]
});
```

**New code:**

```javascript
new GridFieldFilterPickerGroup({
    fields : {
        myStringField : {
            type  : 'string'
        },
        myNumberField : {
            type  : 'number',
            title : 'MyNumber'
        }
    }
});
```

# Upgrade guide for Grid v5.2.0

## The behaviour of the `store.data` getter was changed

Prior to v5.2.0, it returned the **initial** raw dataset. For example:

```javascript
const store = new Store({
    data : [
        { id : 1, name : 'Foo' },
        { id : 2, name : 'Bar' }
    ]
});

store.first.name = 'Baz';
store.last.remove();

// store.data returns the initial data
console.log(store.data); // [{ id : 1, name : 'Foo' }, { id : 2, name : 'Bar' }]
```

In now has the more expected behaviour of returning the data objects for the **current** state instead. The example 
above would instead log:

```javascript
// [{ id : 1, name : 'Baz' }]
```

## Deprecated DomHelper.up()

The `DomHelper.up()` function was deprecated in v5.2.0 and has been removed, since all supported browsers has native 
`element.closest()` which accomplishes the same thing.

**Old code:**

```javascript
const rowElement = DomHelper.up(cellElement, '.b-grid-row');
```

**New code:**

```javascript
const rowElement = cellElement.closest('.b-grid-row');
```

## Asynchronous cell editing

[CellEdit](#Grid/feature/CellEdit) feature [startEditing](#Grid/feature/CellEdit#function-startEditing) and
[finishEditing](#Grid/feature/CellEdit#function-finishEditing) methods were made `async` in v5.2.0.

[finishEditing](#Grid/feature/CellEdit#function-finishEditing) and
[cancelEditing](#Grid/feature/CellEdit#function-cancelEditing) methods was exposed on Grid in v5.2.0.

**Old code:**

```javascript
if (grid.startEditing(...)) {
    // Do something
}
if (grid.features.cellEdit.finishEditing()) {
    // Do something
}
```

**New code:**

```javascript
if (await grid.startEditing(...)) {
    // Do something
}
if (await grid.finishEditing()) {
    // Do something
}
```

## Responsive mixin `breakpoints` config removed

The `breakpoints` config was deprecated in v5.1.0 and has now been removed. This config has been superseded by the 
`responsive` config.

**Old code:**

```javascript
class ResponsiveButton extends Button.mixin(Responsive) {}

const button = new ResponsiveButton({
    breakpoints : {
        width : {
            // When width drops to 50 or below, hide text and show icon
            50 : {
                name    : 'small',
                configs : { text : null, icon : 'b-fa b-fa-plus' }
            },

            // When width is above 50, hide icon and show text
            '*' : {
                 name    : 'large',
                 configs : { text : 'Add', icon : null }
            }
        }
    }
});
```

**New code:**

```javascript
class ResponsiveButton extends Button.mixin(Responsive) {}

const button = new ResponsiveButton({
    responsive : {
        // When width drops to 50 or below, hide text and show icon
        small : {
            when : 50,
            text : null,
            icon : 'b-fa b-fa-plus'
        },

        // When width is above 50, hide icon and show text
        '*' : {
            text : 'Add',
            icon : null
        }
    }
});
```

## Responsive mixin `responsiveWidthChange` and `responsiveHeightChange` events removed

These events were deprecated in v5.2.0 and have now been removed. They were replaced by the `responsiveStateChange` 
event.

**Old code:**

```javascript
class ResponsiveButton extends Button.mixin(Responsive) {}

const button = new ResponsiveButton({
    breakpoints : {
        width : {
            // When width drops to 50 or below, hide text and show icon
            50 : {
                name    : 'small',
                configs : { text : null, icon : 'b-fa b-fa-plus' }
            },

            // When width is above 50, hide icon and show text
            '*' : {
                 name    : 'large',
                 configs : { text : 'Add', icon : null }
            }
        }
    },
    listeners : {
        responsiveWidthChange({ source, breakpoint, prevBreakpoint }) {
            // ...
        }
    }
});
```

**New code:**

```javascript
class ResponsiveButton extends Button.mixin(Responsive) {}

const button = new ResponsiveButton({
    responsive : {
        // When width drops to 50 or below, hide text and show icon
        small : {
            when : 50,
            text : null,
            icon : 'b-fa b-fa-plus'
        },

        // When width is above 50, hide icon and show text
        '*' : {
            text : 'Add',
            icon : null
        }
    },
    listeners : {
        responsiveStateChange({ source, state, oldState }) {
            // ...
        }
    }
});
```

## New module bundle for Angular

Bryntum Grid is since v5.1.0 delivered with a new ES Module bundle without WebComponents. This was done to avoid 
conflicts with Angular which also uses WebComponents for applications.

Angular wrappers use `grid.module.js` bundle in favor of removed `grid.lite.umd.js` one.

Your Angular applications should be upgraded to use the new `grid.module.js` bundle which is set as `main` for
`@bryntum/grid` NPM package.

Replace all application imports from Bryntum packages as shown below:

**Old code:**

```javascript
import { Grid } from '@bryntum/grid/grid.lite.umd.js';
```

**New code:**

```javascript
import { Grid } from '@bryntum/grid';
```

## New module bundle with WebComponents

Bryntum Grid is since v5.1.0 delivered with a new `grid.wc.module.js` ES Module bundle with WebComponents.

Your applications which use WebComponents and modules bundle should be upgraded to import from new `grid.wc.module.js`
instead of `grid.module.js`.

## New Vue wrapper config option `relayStoreEvents`

This option was introduced in v5.0.3 to allow relaying of store events to the Grid instance. It defaults to `false` 
(no events relayed) which changes the default behavior so if your application relies on relayed events, configure it as 
`true`.

Example:

```html
<bryntum-grid
    :relayStoreEvents="true"
>
```

The config option applies to both Vue 2 and Vue 3.

## Widget.showByPoint() removed

Deprecated in v5.0.2. It has been replaced by `Widget.showBy()`, which can be called with the same signature as 
`showByPoint()`. Please update any usages in your code accordingly.

**Old code:**

```javascript
popup.showByPoint(100, 50);
```

**New code:**

```javascript
popup.showBy(100, 50);
```

## `editFilter`, `disableFilter`, `removeFilter` menu item keys renamed

Three menu item keys related to the Filter feature have been renamed. If you customize the presence of
these items in your cell or header menus, you will need to change your code to update the keys:

- `editFilter` -> `filterEdit`
- `disableFilter` -> `filterDisable`
- `removeFilter` -> `filterRemove`

Example of code requiring change:

```javascript
// (Old code)
features : {
    cellMenu : {
        items : {
            // Remove "Edit filter" and "Disable filter" default items
            editFilter    : false,
            disableFilter : false
        }
    },
    headerMenu : {
        items : {
            // Remove "Edit filter", "Remove filter", and "Disable filter"
            editFilter    : false,
            removeFilter  : false,
            disableFilter : false
        }
    }
}
```

New configuration with keys changed:

```javascript
features : {
    cellMenu : {
        items : {
            // Remove "Edit filter" and "Disable filter" default items
            filterEdit    : false,
            filterDisable : false
        }
    },
    headerMenu : {
        items : {
            // Remove "Edit filter", "Remove filter", and "Disable filter"
            filterEdit    : false,
            filterRemove  : false,
            filterDisable : false
        }
    }
}
```

## Store now defaults to use raw data for remotely loaded data

The `useRawData` setting on `Store` is now enabled by default when data is loaded remotely using an `AjaxStore`, but 
with all sub-settings disabled. This will boost load performance slightly, by not cloning the incoming data objects.

If you want to restore the previous behavior, you can set `useRawData : false` on the store:

```javascript
const grid = new Grid({
    store :{
        useRawData : false
    }
});
```

## Multi-select combos now clear typed value on selection

To opt out of this behavior, set `clearTextOnSelection : false` on the combo.

```javascript
const combo = new Combo({
    multiSelect          : true,
    clearTextOnSelection : false
});
```

## Changes to events triggered when moving a record

Previously stores would by default trigger a `remove` event followed by an `add` event and finally a `move` event when 
moving a record. This has been changed, it no longer triggers `remove`. If you rely on the old behavior, you can 
configure the store to do so:

```javascript
const store = new Store({
    fireRemoveEventForMoveAction : true
});
```

## Trees now animate toggling of nodes by default

To opt out of this behavior, set `animateTreeNodeToggle : false` on the (tree)grid:

```javascript
const tree = new TreeGrid({
    animateTreeNodeToggle : false
});
```

## Grid now animates expanding & collapsing regions by default

To opt out of this behavior, set `animateCollapseExpand : false` on the `RegionResize` feature:

```javascript
const grid = new Grid({
    features : {
        regionResize : {
            animateCollapseExpand : false
        }
    }
});
```

## The `relativeToPage` argument to `Rectangle.from()` now defaults to `true`

If you are calling this function and rely on the old behavior, you will need to set the `relativeToPage` argument to
`false`:

```javascript
const rect = Rectangle.from(element, false);
```

## `Store.storeId` was removed

The deprecation was back in v3.0.0, but we have left the code in place until now for backwards compatibility. If you are
relaying on this setting, you will need to change it to use `id` instead:

**Old code**

```javascript
const store = new Store({
    storeId : 'MyStoreId'
});
```

**New code**

```javascript
const store = new Store({
    id : 'MyStoreId'
});
```

## `Store.idField` was removed

Deprecated as far back as in v2.0.0, but we have left the code in place until now for backwards compatibility. If you 
are relaying on this setting to remap the id field, you will need to change it to be remapped in the same way as other
fields are (on your Store or Model):

**Old code**

```javascript
const store = new Store({
    idField : 'MyId'
});
```

**New code**

```javascript
const store = new Store({
    fields : [
        { name : 'id', dataSource : 'MyId' }
    ]
});

// Or

class MyModel extends Model {
    static fields = [
        { name : 'id', dataSource : 'MyId' }
    ];
}

const store = new Store({
    modelClass : MyModel
});
```

## RowExpander event deprecation

To match other features, the events triggered by `RowExpander` have been deprecated and will be removed in v7.0.0. Apps 
should instead listen to new events that are triggered on the grid itself. The following events have been deprecated:

- `beforeExpand`, replaced by `beforeRowExpand` on Grid
- `expand`, replaced by `rowExpand` on Grid
- `beforeCollapse`, replaced by `beforeRowCollapse` on Grid
- `collapse`, replaced by `rowCollapse` on Grid

Please update your code accordingly to avoid it breaking in the future.

**Old code**

```javascript
grid.features.rowExpander.on({
    beforeExpand   : () => {},
    expand         : () => {},
    beforeCollapse : () => {},
    collapse       : () => {}
});
```

**New code**

```javascript
grid.on({
    beforeRowExpand   : () => {},
    rowExpand         : () => {},
    beforeRowCollapse : () => {},
    rowCollapse       : () => {}
});
```

## WidgetHelper deprecated

The `WidgetHelper` utility class has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use the corresponding
widget class instead - `Widget`, `Toast` or `Mask`.

**Old code**

```javascript
WidgetHelper.toast('Hello world');
WidgetHelper.mask('Loading...');
```

**New code**

```javascript
Toast.show('Hello world');
Mask.mask('Loading...');
```

## Location class has been renamed to GridLocation

The `Grid.util.Location` class has been renamed to `Grid.util.GridLocation` to not match the native `Location` class name.

**Old code**

```javascript
import Location from 'PATH_TO_SOURCE/Grid/util/Location.js';
import { Location } from 'PATH_TO_BUILD/grid.module.js';
import { Location } from '@bryntum/grid';
```

**New code**

```javascript
import GridLocation from 'PATH_TO_SOURCE/Grid/util/GridLocation.js';
import { GridLocation } from 'PATH_TO_BUILD/grid.module.js';
import { GridLocation } from '@bryntum/grid';
```

## Events fired by the `RowReorder` feature now have a `source` event param pointing to the Grid instance

Previously, it was referring to the DragHelper instance used internally by the feature. This conforms to how all other 
Grid features fire their events.

**Old code**

```javascript
new Grid({
    gridRowDrag({ source }) {
        // source here is the DragHelper
    }
})
```

**New code**

```javascript
new Grid({
    gridRowDrag({ source }) {
        // source here is the Grid instance
    }
})
```

## Using `renderer` on a WidgetColumn/CheckColumn is now deprecated, in favor of the new `afterRenderCell` column callback

To mutate widgets in a WidgetColumn/CheckColumn, you should now use the `afterRenderCell` callback. You cannot return
anything from this method, it's only meant to be used to mutate the cell / row / widgets.

**Old code**

```javascript
new Grid({
    columns : [
        {
             type  : 'check',
             field : 'enabled',
             renderer({ record, widgets }) {
                 // Hide checkboxes in certain rows
                 widgets[0].hidden = record.readOnly;
             }
        }
    ]
});
```

**New code**

```javascript
new Grid({
    columns : [
        {
             type  : 'check',
             field : 'enabled',
             afterRenderCell({ record, widgets }) {
                 // Hide checkboxes in certain rows
                 widgets[0].hidden = record.readOnly;
             }
        }
    ]
});
```
