# Upgrade guide for Grid v5.3.8

## `RowExpander` feature auto scrolling now defaults to `false`

Previously, when expanding a row and the expanded body element is not completely in view, the `RowExpander` feature
would scroll that element into view automatically. Now, this behaviour will need to be activated by setting the 
`autoScroll` config on the `RowExpander` feature to `true`.
