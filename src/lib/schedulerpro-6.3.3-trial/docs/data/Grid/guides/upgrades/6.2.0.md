# Upgrade guide for Grid v6.2.0

## Exporting grid with row expander feature to PDF

Row expander feature use Web Components and exporting them requires upgrading PDF Export Server to latest version 2.0.0
which was recently released in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bryntum/pdf-export-server/releases) and
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/bryntum/pdf-export-server/general).

## Popups are now draggable by default

IF you want to disable this behavior, set `draggable` config to `false` in the popup config.

**Old code:**

```javascript
const popup = new Popup({
    // ...
});
```

**New code:**

```javascript
const popup = new Popup({
    // ...
    draggable : false
});
```

## Grid cells with overflowing text now use ellipsis by default

If you prefer the old behavior where text is cropped, or if the new approach leads to rendering issues in your app, set 
Grid's `cellEllipsis` property to `false`.

**Old code:**

```javascript
const grid = new Grid({
    // ...
});
```

**New code:**

```javascript
const grid = new Grid({
    // ...
    cellEllipsis : false
});
```

## `showDirty` indicator pseudo-element changed

We changed the `showDirty` indicator pseudo-element from `:before` to `:after` so both the `rowReorder` grip handle and
the `showDirty` indicator can display simultaneously. If you have custom styles targeting `:before` for `showDirty` you
will need to update them to target `:after` instead.

**Old code:**

```css
.b-cell-dirty:before {
    background-color : lightskyblue;
}
```

**New code:**

```css
.b-cell-dirty:after {
    background-color : lightskyblue;
}
```

## AjaxHelper.fetch credentials change

The `AjaxHelper.fetch()` utility function is used by `AjaxStore` to fetch data from the server. Previously it by default 
used the `credentials: 'include'` option, which meant that cookies were always sent with the request. To better match 
the default behavior of the native `fetch` API, our default value has been removed (thus it instead uses 
`'same-origin'`, which is the native default). If you want to restore the old behavior, you can do so using
`AjaxHelper.DEFAULT_FETCH_OPTIONS`:

**Old code**

```javascript
new AjaxStore({
    readUrl  : 'load.php',
    autoLoad : true
})
```

**New code**

```javascript
AjaxHelper.DEFAULT_FETCH_OPTIONS = { credentials : 'include' };

new AjaxStore({
    readUrl  : 'load.php',
    autoLoad : true
})
```
