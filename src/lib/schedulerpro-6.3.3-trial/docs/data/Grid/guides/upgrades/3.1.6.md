# Upgrade guide for Grid v3.1.6

## Angular, React and Vue `gridEngine` has been renamed to `gridInstance`

To avoid confusing the calculating engine with the instance of Bryntum Grid, `gridEngine` has been renamed to
`gridInstance`. The change is backwards compatible hence applications using `gridEngine` will still work, but with
deprecation warning in the console.

Change all occurrences of `gridEngine` to `gridInstance` in your Angular, React or Vue application to get rid of the
warning and to make the application consistent with Bryntum Grid wrapper naming.
